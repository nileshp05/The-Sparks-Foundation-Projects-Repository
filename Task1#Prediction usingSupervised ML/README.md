Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours
In this project, I build a simple linear regression model to study linear relationship between the score of student and the number of study hours.

Our aim is to model and study the relationship.

## Example
Student who studies for 9.25 hours is estimated to get a score of 92.14.
