Implement an image color detector which identifies all the colors in an image.
Build an application called a 'Image Color Identifier' which describes the color name and other details in box at location of mouse pointer when user double clicks on image. For this purpose I have used a CSV file named as colors.csv which includes the dataset of color with color names and RGB values.
